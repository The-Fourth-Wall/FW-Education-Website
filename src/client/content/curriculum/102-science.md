  - basic principles of chemical sensors.

  - materials science
  - atomic & molecular structure
  - basic atomic model (protons, electrons, valence electrons)
  - bonding (covalent, ionic)
  - how atoms form materials (repeated bonding patterns lead to larger structures).
  - properties of materials
  - conductors
  - materials that allow electric current to flow easily
  - abundance of free electrons in metals
  - copper, aluminum, gold
  - insulators
  - materials that resist the flow of electric current
  - electrons are tightly bound to atoms (large band gap)
  - (silicon dioxide, plastics, glass, air)
  - semiconductors (intrinsic vs. doped)
  - controlled conductivity between insulators and conductors
  - intrinsic (silicon, germanium)
  - doped (n-type, p-type, p-n junction)
  - scale & nanotechnology
  - introduction to nanoscale phenomena
  - 1-100 nm
  - quantum effects line tunnelling, confinement break down conventional physics
  - relevance to transistor size
  - transistors can become so small that we have heat dissipation problems, leakage due to quantum effects
  - materials science.
  - Graphene, carbon nanotubes
  - biocompatibility concepts
  - pacemakers, defibrillators, neural implants, cochlear implants, knee implants
  - wearable smartwatches, fitness trackers
  - medical monitors

  - biology
  - information storage & processing
  - DNA structure and replication as information encoding/copying
  - nucleotides (sugar, phosphate, base)
  - hydrogen bonds between base pairs (A-T, C-G) and their role in stability and unzipping for replication
  - replication by DNA polymerase as the builder
  - evolutionary concepts
  - natural selection (variation, heritability, fitness, result)
  - adaptation as optimization processes. (newer iterations become better designed)
